# React Router Tutorial

React Router enables "client side routing".

## Client Side Routing
Client side routing allows your app to update the URL from a link click without making another request for another document from the server. This enables faster user experiences because the browser doesn't need to request an entirely new document or re-evaluate CSS and JavaScript assets for the next page.

## Nested Routes
Nested Routing is the general idea of coupling segments of the URL to component hierarchy and data.

## Dynamic Segments
  ```
  <Route path="projects/:projectId/tasks/:taskId" />
  ```
